User - System interaction.

Console asks user for input.
Input Format:
9 lines, each describing the sudoku.
Each line consists of 9 characters: [1-9|' '].

System provides the following information back to the user:
0) Possible case of bad input.
1) Sequential steps of reasoning for each deduction.
2) Final output sudoku: either of the solved form, or an incomplete form stating "could not solve completely with the given arsenal of tricks".

Before input, system stores in all row[][][], col[][][], block[][][], the values "true" (i.e. we assume that any  number can go anywhere). After input, for each value inputted, we reassign boolean values in row[][][], col[][][], block[][][] based on input.

Finally, we run the algorithm(s).
